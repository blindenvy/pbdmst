PBDMST Algorithm.

Star when solved, newest on top
- warning in processFile.h: 58, 84: eCount set but not used
- search ?02? in pbdmst.cxx: question about how edges are being
  initialized
- search ?01? in pbdmst.cxx: can NFS support concurrent reads for
  initializing the graphs? currently implemented so that each process
  steps through individually
* pass the main command line arguments; MPI requires argc and argv in
  MPI_Init()
* change main loop to run to full duration every time so we don't have
  to worry about processes finishing out of sync
- packPheromones() as it stands will write edges twice, one for each side
  of the edge
